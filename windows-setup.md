# Windows Setup

Welcome Windows users! Your operating system comes from a different lineage than
most operating systems: Windows has its roots in MS-DOS and Windows NT, while
macOS and Linux are both "Unix"-style operating systems. Everyone in this course
will be using the Unix command line with its associated tools. Windows does not
include a Unix-style system by default, so you are going to use an add-on piece
of Microsoft Technology called "Windows Subsystem for Linux", or WSL.

## WSL

Windows Subsystem for Linux is a Linux Virtual Computer that you run on your
PC. It gives you all the same tools and command line utilities that your
Mac- and Linux-using classmates use.

To install WSL you must have a specific version of Windows 10.

> For x64 systems: Version 1903 or higher, with Build 18362 or higher.

If you do not have this version or cannot update to this version, please
contact an instructor.

## Installing WSL 2

Future versions of Windows will include an automatic installer for WSL, but
for now you will have to use the manual install instructions:

[Windows Subsystem for Linux Installation Guide for Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#manual-installation-steps)

Follow this guide to install WSL 2 and Ubuntu Linux. We recommend installing
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, found
[here](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9N9TNGVNDL3Q).

## Tips for using WSL

You will launch the Ubuntu terminal when the instructions in the curriculum tell
you to open a Terminal.

You should always store your code files in your Ubuntu home directory and not in
your Windows users home directory on your C: drive. Many of the tools you will
be using will perform better and be more stable if the files exist on the Ubuntu
filesystem.

If you do need to access the files in your Ubuntu home directory from Windows
Explorer, you can type `Windows + R` to bring up the run command dialog and type
`\\wsl$\home\<your-username>` replacing `<your-username>` with your Ubuntu
username. (You can find your Ubuntu username by typing `whoami` at your Ubuntu
terminal prompt.)

If you want to access your Windows hard drive from Ubuntu, you can use the path
`/mnt/c` inside of the Ubuntu virtual machine.

If you ever need to restart the Ubuntu virtual machine, you need to open a
Powershell window and run the following command:

```text
wsl --shutdown
```

The next time you open the Ubuntu terminal, it will start the virtual machine
back up.

## Install everything else

Now that you have WSL installed you can install all the rest of these tools in
this order:

### Google Chrome

1. Using your default internet browser, navigate to the [Google Chrome Download]
   page.
2. Download and run the installer.
3. When prompted, set Google Chrome as your default internet browser.

[Google Chrome Download]:https://www.google.com/chrome/

### Visual Studio Code

1. Using Google Chrome, navigate to the [VS Code Download] page.
2. Download and run the Windows installer.

### rbenv & Ruby

1. Run the following commands in your Ubuntu terminal to install `rbenv`:

   ```text
   sudo apt install git curl libssl-dev libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev autoconf bison build-essential libyaml-dev libreadline-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev libgdbm-dev
   curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/HEAD/bin/rbenv-installer | bash
   echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'export EDITOR="code --wait"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. Run the following commands in your Ubuntu terminal to install the correct
   version of Ruby and the gems you'll be using in the course:

   ```text
   rbenv install 3.1.1
   rbenv global 3.1.1
   rbenv rehash
   gem install bundler pry byebug
   gem install rails -v 7.0.3
   rbenv rehash
   ```

### PostgreSQL & SQLite

1. Run the following commands in your Ubuntu terminal to install PostgreSQL:

   ```text
   sudo apt-get install postgresql libpq-dev
   sudo service postgresql start
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

   > Note that you will need to run the command `sudo service postgresql start`
   > **every time you restart the virtual machine**. We recommend creating an
   > alias for this and any other commands you find yourself running on a
   > regular basis.

2. Run the following commands in your Ubuntu terminal to create a new PostgreSQL
   user

   > Note that you need to replace `your_username` with the username that you
   > created for your Ubuntu virtual machine

   ```text
   sudo -u postgres psql
   CREATE USER your_username WITH SUPERUSER CREATEROLE CREATEDB REPLICATION;
   ALTER ROLE your_username WITH BYPASSRLS;
   CREATE DATABASE your_username;
   \q
   ```

3. Run the following command in your Ubuntu terminal to install SQLite:

   ```text
   sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
   ```

### nvm & Node.js

1. Run the following commands in your Ubuntu terminal to install `nvm` and the
   correct version of Node.js:

   ```text
   curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh -o install_nvm.sh
   bash install_nvm.sh
   source ~/.bashrc
   nvm install 18
   nvm use 18
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```
